# Notes regarding the TOML format, which is like an INI file:
#
# * Values surrounded by quotation marks are strings: "Vendor"
#   Literal quotation marks must be escaped using a backslash: "\""
#   Literal backslashes must also be escaped using a backslash: "\\"
# * Boolean values use the words "true" and "false" without quotes.
# * Numbers that begin with 0x are interpreted as hexadecimal: 0x30
