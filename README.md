# mini-lab

The mini-lab is a small, virtual setup to locally run the metal-stack. It deploys the metal control plane and a metal-stack partition with two simulated leaf switches. The lab can be used for trying out metal-stack, demonstration purposes or development.

## Requirements

- Linux machine with hardware virtualization support
- kvm as hypervisor for the VMs (you can check through the `kvm-ok` command)
- [docker](https://www.docker.com/) >= 24.x.y (for using kind and our deployment base image)
- [kind](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind/releases) == v0.23.0 (for hosting the metal control plane)
- [containerlab](https://containerlab.dev/install/) >= v0.56.0
- the lab creates a docker network on your host machine with the address block `203.0.113.0/24`, designated as TEST-NET-3 for documentation and examples.
- (recommended) haveged to have enough random entropy (only needed if the PXE process does not work)

Here is some code that should help you to set up most of the requirements:

```bash
# If UFW enabled.
# Disable the firewall or allow traffic through Docker network IP range.
sudo ufw status
sudo ufw allow from 172.17.0.0/16

# Install kvm
sudo apt install -y git curl qemu qemu-kvm haveged

# Install Docker
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sh
# if you want to be on the safe side, follow the original installation
# instructions at https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/

# Ensure that your user is member of the group "docker"
# you need to login again in order to make this change take effect
sudo usermod -G docker -a ${USER}

# Install containerlab
bash -c "$(curl -sL https://get.containerlab.dev)"

# Install kind (kubernetes in docker), for more details see https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#installation
sudo curl -Lo /usr/local/bin/kind "https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/dl/v0.20.0/kind-linux-amd64"
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/kind
```

The following ports are used statically on your host machine:

| Port | Bind Address | Description                        |
| :--: | :----------- | :--------------------------------- |
| 6443 | 0.0.0.0      | kube-apiserver of the kind cluster |
| 4443 | 0.0.0.0      | HTTPS ingress                      |
| 4150 | 0.0.0.0      | nsqd                               |
| 8080 | 0.0.0.0      | HTTP ingress                       |

## Known Limitations

- to keep the demo small there is no EVPN
- machine restart and destroy does not work because we cannot change the boot order via IPMI in the lab easily (virtual-bmc could, but it's buggy)
- login to the machines is possible with virsh console, login to the firewall is possible with SSH from your local machine

## Try it out

```bash
git clone https://github.com/metal-stack/mini-lab.git
cd mini-lab
```

Start the mini-lab with a kind cluster, a metal-api instance as well as two containers wrapping leaf switches and another container that hosts two user-allocatable machines:

```bash
make
# containerlab will ask you for root permissions (https://github.com/srl-labs/containerlab/issues/669)
```

After the deployment and waiting for a short amount of time, two machines in status `PXE booting` become visible through `metalctl machine ls`:

```bash
docker compose run --rm metalctl machine ls

ID                                          LAST EVENT   WHEN     AGE  HOSTNAME  PROJECT  SIZE          IMAGE  PARTITION
e0ab02d2-27cd-5a5e-8efc-080ba80cf258    ‚Äá   PXE Booting  3s
2294c949-88f6-5390-8154-fa53d93a3313        PXE Booting  5s
```

Wait until the machines reach the waiting state:

```bash
docker compose run --rm metalctl machine ls

ID                                          LAST EVENT   WHEN     AGE  HOSTNAME  PROJECT  SIZE          IMAGE  PARTITION
e0ab02d2-27cd-5a5e-8efc-080ba80cf258    ‚Äá   Waiting      8s                               v1-small-x86         mini-lab
2294c949-88f6-5390-8154-fa53d93a3313    ‚Äá   Waiting      8s                               v1-small-x86         mini-lab
```

Create a firewall and a machine with:

```bash
make firewall
make machine
```

**Alternatively**, you may want to issue the `metalctl` commands on your own:

```bash
docker compose run --rm metalctl network allocate \
        --partition mini-lab \
        --project 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 \
        --name user-private-network

# lookup the network ID and create a machine
docker compose run --rm metalctl machine create \
        --description test \
        --name machine \
        --hostname machine \
        --project 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 \
        --partition mini-lab \
        --image ubuntu-20.04 \
        --size v1-small-x86 \
        --networks <network-ID>

# create a firewall that is also connected to the virtual internet-mini-lab network
docker compose run --rm metalctl machine create \
        --description fw \
        --name fw \
        --hostname fw \
        --project 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 \
        --partition mini-lab \
        --image firewall-ubuntu-2.0 \
        --size v1-small-x86 \
        --networks internet-mini-lab,$(privatenet)
```

```

Login with user name metal and the console password from

```bash
docker compose run --rm metalctl machine consolepassword e0ab02d2-27cd-5a5e-8efc-080ba80cf258
```

To remove the kind cluster, the switches and machines, run:

```bash
make cleanup
```

### Reinstall machine

Reinstall a machine with

```bash
docker compose run --rm metalctl machine reinstall \
        --image ubuntu-20.04 \
        e0ab02d2-27cd-5a5e-8efc-080ba80cf258
```

### Free machine

Free a machine with `make free-machine01` or

```bash
docker compose run --rm metalctl machine rm e0ab02d2-27cd-5a5e-8efc-080ba80cf258
```

## Flavors

There are two versions, or flavors, of the mini-lab environment which differ in regards to the NOS running on the leaves:

- `cumulus` -- runs 2 Cumulus switches.
- `sonic` -- runs 2 SONiC switches

In order to start specific flavor, you can define the flavor as follows:

```bash
export MINI_LAB_FLAVOR=sonic
make
```

# Connect Firewall Controller to Kind Cluster

We need a few different repositories, if you see a üíø icon you need to change the to the repository that is written after the icon. Using tmux or any terminal multiplexer is recommended. üåû

To establish a connection between the Firewall Controller (FC) and the Kind cluster, you need to configure routing between the FC and the Kind cluster. Follow the steps below to set this up:

## 1. Configure BGP

### üíø MINI-LAB

Run the following command to configure BGP:

```bash
make configure-bgp
```

```bash
make _privatenet
```

## 2. Deploy FC to Connect to the Kind Cluster

### üíø FIREWALL-CONTROLLER-MANAGER

Before executing replace the args of the config/examples/deployment.yaml with:

```yaml
args:
  - -metal-api-url=http://metal-api.metal-control-plane.svc.cluster.local:8080/metal
  - -cert-dir=/certs
  - -log-level=info
  - -seed-api-url=http://172.17.0.1
  - -enable-leader-election
  - -namespace=firewall
  - -shoot-kubeconfig-secret-name=generic-token-kubeconfig ## Need to create this urself bc usually gardener creates this
  - -shoot-token-secret-name=firewall-controller-shoot-access-firewall
  - -ssh-key-secret-name=ssh-secret
```

Now run:

```bash
make deploy
```

## 3. Update .seed-kubeconfig

You also need to update the .seed-kubeconfig file on the machine. Follow these steps:

    Connect to the machine.
    Replace the existing /etc/firewall-controller/.seed-kubeconfig with the output of the following command:

### üíø MINI-LAB

```bash
make generate-insecure-kubeconfig
```

## Running Your Local Firewall Controller in Mini-Lab

To run your own local Firewall Controller (FC) in the mini-lab, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Metal-Images Repository

Pull the metal-images repository. 2. Build Your Local Firewall Controller

### üíø FIREWALL-CONTROLLER

```bash
make docker
```

### 3. Modify the Firewall/Dockerfile

### üíø METAL-IMAGES

Replace:

```bash
FROM ghcr.io/metal-stack/firewall-controller:${FIREWALL_CONTROLLER_VERSION} AS firewall-controller-artifacts
```

With:

```bash
FROM my-local-firewall-controller:latest AS firewall-controller-artifacts
```

### 4. Build the Firewall Image

```bash
make firewall
```

Sometimes the test.sh line in the **builds.after** fail Just remove that whole line in all the docker-make files.

### 5. Serve the Built Images

Start a local HTTP server to serve the images. From within the metal-images repository:

```bash
cd images
python3 -m http.server 8000 --bind 0.0.0.0
```

### 6. Create Firewall Image in Mini-Lab

### üíø MINI-LAB

```bash
make create-firewall-image
```

**Make sure that spec.template.spec.image is firewall-ubuntu-4.0.‚ùó**

Now create the firewalldeployment.yaml inside the config/examples directory inside the fcm repository.

Now your local Firewall Controller should be running in the mini-lab environment and also has connection to your cluster! Great job! üí™
