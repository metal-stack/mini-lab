# mini-lab

The mini-lab is a small, virtual setup to locally run the metal-stack. It deploys the metal control plane and a metal-stack partition with two simulated leaf switches. The lab can be used for trying out metal-stack, demonstration purposes or development.

ℹ This project can also be used as a template for writing your own metal-stack deployments.

## Requirements

- Linux machine with hardware virtualization support
- kvm as hypervisor for the VMs (you can check through the `kvm-ok` command)
- [docker](https://www.docker.com/) >= 18.09 (for using kind and our deployment base image)
- [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) >= 2.0 (for ease of use and for parallelizing control plane and partition deployment)
- [kind](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kind/releases) == v0.15.0 (for hosting the metal control plane on a kubernetes cluster v1.25)
- [containerlab](https://containerlab.srlinux.dev/install/) == v0.25.1
- the lab creates a docker network on your host machine (`172.17.0.1`), this hopefully does not overlap with other networks you have
- (recommended) haveged to have enough random entropy (only needed if the PXE process does not work)

Here is some code that should help you to set up most of the requirements:

 ```bash
# Install kvm
sudo apt install -y git curl qemu qemu-kvm haveged

# Install Docker
curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com | sh
# if you want to be on the safe side, follow the original installation
# instructions at https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/

# Ensure that your user is member of the group "docker"
# you need to login again in order to make this change take effect
sudo usermod -G docker -a ${USER}

# Install containerlab
bash -c "$(curl -sL https://get.containerlab.dev)"

# Install kind (kubernetes in docker), for more details see https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/#installation
sudo curl -Lo /usr/local/bin/kind "https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/dl/latest/kind-linux-amd64"
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/kind

# Install docker-compose, for more details see https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/
sudo curl -Lo /usr/local/bin/docker-compose "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/latest/download/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)"
sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

The following ports are used statically on your host machine:

| Port | Bind Address | Description                        |
|:----:|:------------ |:---------------------------------- |
| 6443 |   0.0.0.0    | kube-apiserver of the kind cluster |
| 4443 |   0.0.0.0    | HTTPS ingress                      |
| 4150 |   0.0.0.0    | nsqd                               |
| 4161 |   0.0.0.0    | nsq-lookupd                        |
| 8080 |   0.0.0.0    | HTTP ingress                       |

## Known Limitations

- to keep the demo small there is no EVPN
- machine restart and destroy does not work because we cannot change the boot order via IPMI in the lab easily (virtual-bmc could, but it's buggy)
- login to the machines is possible with virsh console, login to the firewall is possible with SSH from your local machine

## Try it out

```bash
git clone https://github.com/metal-stack/mini-lab.git
cd mini-lab
```

Start the mini-lab with a kind cluster, a metal-api instance as well as two containers wrapping leaf switches and another container that hosts two user-allocatable machines:

```bash
make
# containerlab will ask you for root permissions (https://github.com/srl-labs/containerlab/issues/669)
```

After the deployment and waiting for a short amount of time, two machines in status `PXE booting` become visible through `metalctl machine ls`:

```bash
docker-compose run metalctl machine ls

ID                                          LAST EVENT   WHEN     AGE  HOSTNAME  PROJECT  SIZE          IMAGE  PARTITION
e0ab02d2-27cd-5a5e-8efc-080ba80cf258        PXE Booting  3s
2294c949-88f6-5390-8154-fa53d93a3313        PXE Booting  5s
```

Wait until the machines reach the waiting state:

```bash
docker-compose run metalctl machine ls

ID                                          LAST EVENT   WHEN     AGE  HOSTNAME  PROJECT  SIZE          IMAGE  PARTITION
e0ab02d2-27cd-5a5e-8efc-080ba80cf258        Waiting      8s                               v1-small-x86         mini-lab
2294c949-88f6-5390-8154-fa53d93a3313        Waiting      8s                               v1-small-x86         mini-lab
```

Create a firewall and a machine with:

```bash
make firewall
make machine
```

__Alternatively__, you may want to issue the `metalctl` commands on your own:

```bash
docker-compose run metalctl network allocate \
        --partition mini-lab \
        --project 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 \
        --name user-private-network

# lookup the network ID and create a machine
docker-compose run metalctl machine create \
        --description test \
        --name machine \
        --hostname machine \
        --project 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 \
        --partition mini-lab \
        --image ubuntu-20.04 \
        --size v1-small-x86 \
        --networks <network-ID>

# create a firewall that is also connected to the virtual internet-mini-lab network
docker-compose run metalctl machine create \
        --description fw \
        --name fw \
        --hostname fw \
        --project 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000 \
        --partition mini-lab \
        --image firewall-ubuntu-2.0 \
        --size v1-small-x86 \
        --networks internet-mini-lab,$(privatenet)
```

```

Two machines are now installed and have status "Phoned Home"

```bash
docker-compose run metalctl machine ls
ID                                          LAST EVENT   WHEN   AGE     HOSTNAME  PROJECT                               SIZE          IMAGE                             PARTITION

```

Login with user name metal and the console password from

```bash
docker-compose run metalctl machine consolepassword e0ab02d2-27cd-5a5e-8efc-080ba80cf258
```

If you want to access the firewall with SSH or have internet connectivity from the firewall and machine, you'll need to have a static route configured that points to the leaf switches:

```bash
# Add the route to the network internet-mini-lab 100.255.254.0/24 via leaf01 and leaf02, whose IPs are dynamically allocated. Make sure there's no old route before execution.
make route

# Connect to the firewall
ssh metal@100.255.254.1
```

To remove the kind cluster, the switches and machines, run:

```bash
make cleanup
```

### Reinstall machine

Reinstall a machine with

```bash
docker-compose run metalctl machine reinstall \
        --image ubuntu-20.04 \
        e0ab02d2-27cd-5a5e-8efc-080ba80cf258
```

### Free machine

Free a machine with

```bash
docker-compose run metalctl machine rm e0ab02d2-27cd-5a5e-8efc-080ba80cf258
```

## Flavors

There's few versions of mini-lab environment that you can run. We call them flavors. There's 2 flavors at the moment:

- `default` -- runs 2 machines.
- `cluster-api` -- runs 3 machines. Useful for testing Control plane and worker node deployment with [Cluster API provider](https://github.com/metal-stack/cluster-api-provider-metalstack).
- `sonic` -- use SONiC as network operating system for the leaves

In order to start specific flavor, you can define the flavor as follows:

```bash
export MINI_LAB_FLAVOR=cluster-api
make
```
