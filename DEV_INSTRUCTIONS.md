# Dev Instructions

To simplify developing changes for the `metal-api`, `metal-hammer` and `metal-core`, it is possible to use development artifacts from within the mini-lab.

Also start the mini-lab with a kind cluster, a metal-api instance
as well as some vagrant VMs with two leaf switches and two machine skeletons.
Additionally a Caddy and a Docker registry container is started.
The former serves a prebuilt `metal-hammer-initrd` image, the latter holds
prebuilt `metalstack/metal-api` and `metalstack/metal-core` images,
which will be used as replacements for the official ones.

Thus you have to clone the following **metal-stack** repositories:

## Prerequisites:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/metal-stack/metal-hammer ../metal-hammer
git clone https://github.com/metal-stack/metal-api ../metal-api
git clone https://github.com/metal-stack/metal-core ../metal-core
```

## Start/Stop:

Build `metal-hammer-initrd`, `metalstack/metal-api` and `metalstack/metal-core` images and (re)start
a minimal metal-stack system as well as a Caddy container that servers the former one
and a Docker registry that holds the latter ones:

```bash
make dev
```

Stop and cleanup a potentially running metal-stack development system
as well as the local Caddy and Docker registry containers:

```bash
make down
```

## Exchange images at run-time:

Reload metal-hammer-initrd:

```bash
make build-hammer-initrd
```

Reload metal-api:

```bash
make reload-api
```

Reload metal-core:

```bash
make reload-core
```
