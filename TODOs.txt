Hier war, was ich mir aufgeschrieben hatte:
- metal-api logs not scrapable (some others work though?) -> metal-api is scrapable
- Thanos does not appear in data source, is it normal?    -> prometheus/default datasource is thanos frontend
- Gardener dashboards are partially outdated
- Targets in the partition are almost down everywhere (except for mgmt-servers and some targets on the leaves)
- We do not see any alerts from the partition? Also SONIC exporter not reachable does not seem to work
  - mgmtserver02 was not able to send metrics anymore because of a full drive, but no alerts
- Promtails on the mgmtserver do not run: "/etc/promtail/promtail.yaml: yaml: line 10: did not find expected key"



Fixes:

Grafana:
- updated helm-chart version
- added plugin to for alertmanager-query
- adjusted alerts dashboards

Promtheus on leafs:
- prometheus couldn't scrap pixiecore
- prometheus was trying to reach with 127.0.0.1:2113 from inside docker container -> changed network to host

Exporter:
- targets sind hier leer?
